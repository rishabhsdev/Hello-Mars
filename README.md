# Hello-Mars
Service to fetch Mars data using NASA API.

Made with JAVA and SpringBoot.

I was always amazed by NASA's public API, so I created this hobby project to test it myself.

This code uses Insight rover API to fetch data from Mars.

Update:
Insight rover has stopped sending data, so currently working on new API for the project. -> [**curiosity API**](https://github.com/rishabhsdev/Hello-Mars/blob/main/curiosityAPI/CuriosityAPI.java)
