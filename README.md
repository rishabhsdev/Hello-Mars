# Hello-Mars
Service to fetch Mars data using NASA API.

I was amazed by NASA's public API, so I created this hobby project to test it.

This code uses Insight rover API to fetch data from Mars.

Update:
Insight rover has stopped sending data, so currently working on new API for the project. -> [curiosity API](https://github.com/rishabhsdev/curiosity-mars-api)
